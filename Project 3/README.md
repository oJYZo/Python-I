# Trucking Network -- Dijkstra’s algorithm

# Processes
- Import Data: add new cities in the file
- Build network
- Define network
- Compute the distance to hub cities
- import the CSV file
- Build the graph
- uncomment to print the graph
- Compute the least cost

# Description
This project mainly used Dijkstra’s algorithm as finding the least distance from a start to a destination city. And the important critira for this shortest distance is any path must go through both New Orleans and St. Louis. The cities network showed as following:
