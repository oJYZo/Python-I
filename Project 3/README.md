# Shortest Distances between a Network of Cities

# Part A

- Import Data: add new cities in the file
- Build network
- Define network
- Compute the distance to hub cities
- Compute the least cost

# Part B
This project mainly used Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm as finding the least distance between two cities where the weights are the distances between cities.
